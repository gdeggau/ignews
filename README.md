## About the project

The goal of this project is to build a application where user is able to subscribe to a React newsletter and read the posts published by some administrator.

The application follows [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/) concepts, is was built over NextJS framework using some of their features like API routes, Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). In this project we also have integrations with Stripe to user pay the subscription monthly, NextAuth using Github as provider where user is able to login, FaunaBD to save user data and Prismic CMS where some administrator can manage the posts content.

This project was built during module 03 of <b>Ignite</b> course from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
